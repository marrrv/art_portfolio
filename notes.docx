Portals add "confluence" and under "traveling perspectives" add "traveling perspectives—
same space, conversation starting
movement and motion, motion and sound
rhythm that dances dependent on both.

verbal communication is ambiguous,
and the silence is transient.

it’s essential to look at all
especially, the sight that prevails." under the image
